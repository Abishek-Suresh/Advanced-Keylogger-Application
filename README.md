# Advanced-Keylogger-Application
This keylogger application is build with python and Compiled with Nuitka. The functionality of this keylogger doesn't stop at capturing keystrokes, it can take screenshots, record audio, collect important information such as system info and even get the stored wifi SSIDs and passwords from the system and send it to an email address, we just have to mention the number of iterations we want the keylogger program to run along with the time span for each iterations. For ethical reasons, I've not uploaded the executable file here in github, as it can evade antivirus such as malwarebytes or even windows defender. I've used Nuitka to compile the python script in such a way that it evades the antivirus and it does everything under the radar. This is a proof of concept and can be developed even further. 

## Possible future developments
- I've already tried to add screen recording feature using the python module ffmpeg. Yet to develop
- Indroducing Cryptography, encrypting the log files that we collect and then sent it via mail such that others can't access to the data without the decrpyting it.
- Not just stopping with mail, we can further develop this application such that it can send all the collected information to a server.
- and much more ...
